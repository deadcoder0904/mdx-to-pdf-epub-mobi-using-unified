# mdx-to-pdf-epub-mobi-using-unified

first, write a book in `.mdx` so that you can import chapters as files.

you cannot use `.md` if you want to import files. only `.mdx` supports importing of files.

then use `mdx-bundler` to add classnames to the `.mdx` file.

use `print.css` to have print styles.

use tailwind to style the book aesthetically.

open the book in a web browser & print it using playwright.

get the pdf.

use the pdf to generate epub.

convert from epub to mobi.

viola, you have pdf, epub, and mobi.
